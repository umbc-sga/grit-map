An interactive map that pulls data from a multitude of sources.

- Menu data from DineOnCampus API
- Transit stop locations/times from TransLoc API
- Laundry machine usage from LaundryView API
- All gender restroom locations (from the Women's Center)
- Free menstrual product locations (from SGA)
- Napping locations from NapMap
- Incident reports from UMBC Police data
- Building hours (hardcoded or maybe myUMBC has this)
